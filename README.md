- 👋 Hi, I’m @nam-k-nguyen
- 👀 I am interested in Web Development. Stuff like Node.js, Express.js, React, and more!
- 🌱 I am learning everything I find interesting about Web Development. Currently, I am digging Puppeteer, a Node.js library for web scraping, testing, and automation!
- 💞️ I love to collab on projects so if you need me, I can lend you a hand in your 💹 **million-dollar-idea** 💹 project!
- 📫 You can reach me at nguye2nk@mail.uc.edu.
